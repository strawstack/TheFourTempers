# Animation Overview

Starts small and enlarges toward camera
(possibly use animated scale for this)

Below repeats per "page"

    Horizontal line animates from top to bottom (0.25s)

    Letter tabs fade in quickly (0.2s)
    And animate up in height their last 20%
    Loop back to the left when at right side

    Names change every time line passes

    Wheel on each side is horizontal bars that animate down
    Bar spacing is one bar in center and 0 on top and bottom
    (this could easily be a short repeating animation in a loop)
    (like animate down two bars, opacity 0, shift up, repeat)
